The natural numbers are the numbers you can count $N$ 
The integers are the naturals with their negatives and zero  $Z$
The rationals are the integers with their quotients $Q$ 


Theorem 4.1. ($Q$  Has Holes)
There exist subsets of the rational numbers that have no smallest number, and there exist
others that have no largest number.


Defifinition 4.2. (Ordered Set)
An order on a set S is a relation, symbolized by <, that has the following properties:
Property 1. For x, y ∈ S, exactly one of the following is true:
					 x < y, or x = y, or y < x.
Property 2. For x, y,z ∈ S, if x < y and y < z, then x < z.


Defifinition 4.3. (Minimum and Maximum)
The minimum of an ordered set A is the smallest element in A. The maximum of an
ordered set A is the largest element in A.


Defifinition 4.5. (Bounds)

Let E be a subset of an ordered set S.

If there exists an α ∈ S such that every element of E is less than or equal to α, then α is an upper bound of E, and E is bounded above.

$\exists$ a $\in$ S such that $\forall$ x $\in$ E, x $\leq$ a  

If there exists a β ∈ S such that every element of E is greater than or equal to β, then β is a lower bound of E, and E is bounded below.

$\exists$ b $\in$ S such that $\forall$ x $\in$ E, x $\geq$ b.


Defifinition 4.7. (Supremum 上确界 and Infifimum 下确界)
Let E be a subset of an ordered set S. 

If there exists an upper bound α of E in S such that anything in S that is less than α is not an upper bound of E, then α is the least upper bound or supremum of E.

$\sup E$  

If there exists a lower bound β of E in S such that anything in S that is greater than β is not a lower bound of E, then β is the greatest lower bound or infifimum of E

$\inf E$ 

Theorem 4.9. (Bounds Contained in a Set)
Let E be a subset of an ordered set S. If an upper bound of E is contained in E, then it is a least upper bound. If a lower bound of E is contained in E, then it is a greatest lower bound.


Defifinition 4.10. An ordered set S has the least upper bound property if, for every nonempty subset E which is bounded above in S, $\sup$ E  exists in S.

Theorem 4.12. (Supremum of Lower Bounds)

Let S be an ordered set with the least upper bound property. Then S also has the greatest lower bound property—namely, for every nonempty subset B which is bounded below in S, inf B exists in S.

Theorem 4.13. (Infifimum of Upper Bounds)

Let S be an ordered set with the greatest lower bound property. Then S also has the least upper bound property—namely, for every nonempty subset B which is bounded above in S, sup B exists in S.
