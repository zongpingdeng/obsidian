Defifinition 7.1. (Function)
If, for each element x in the set A, there is a corresponding unique element $f (x)$ in the
set B, then the relation f is a function (also called a mapping). We say $f$ maps A to B,
and we writeï¼š
			$f : A \to B$ ,  $f: f \mapsto f(x)$ 
The set A is called the $\color {red} {domain}$  of $f$ , and the set B is called the $\color {red} {codomain}$ of $f$
