The La Place transform is a tool to solve the linear differential equation in an easy and elegant way since it transforms a linear differential equation into algebraic equation.

In order to solve for the response of a system in a time domain upon an application of time domain stimuli, one must solve the linear system of the differential equations mathematically modelling the system together with the initial and boundary conditions. Such solution will be normally tedious.

But using the La Place transform to transform the equations from time domain into the S-domain, which is called the complex frequency domain, one can convert the time domain differential equations into S-domain algebraic equations.

Naturally simultaneously solving algebraic equations is much easier than solving simultaneous differential equations. This is the power of this mathematical transformation.

As for the Fourier transform, it is a tool for transforming time domain functions into frequency domain function. Physically any time domain function can be thought of a summation of complex exponential signals. And this what the Fourier transform yield. So, it is an analysis tool of time domain signals.

The Fourier transform is a subset of the La Place transform as the colleagues above pointed.
